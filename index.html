			<div class="content">
				<p>The AI is made using a Behaviour Tree and BlackBoard connected to blueprints that interface with the game
				world, this is layered on top of a C++ base class. This kind of structure felt to me like it would make it
				easier for programmer and designer alike to change and/or add behaviors where they made sense, or if we
				wanted to move something down to code and expose a blueprint node for example.
				<br>
				<br>The first problem that came to my table was to make the AI of the friendly agents. The general design
				was that they were to activate and make noise when the player was nearby, and when interacted with they'd
				make their own way to the battering ram. This was quickly changed as we spoke about it, and to save some
				time on both design and programming for the MVP we decided to alter the behaviour. Now when they detect
				the player by hearing they will active and follow the player until interacted with and thereby be
				teleported to the battering ram.
				<br>
				<br>As the agents are teleported to the battering ram they're supposed to attach to certain points and
				start pushing the ram forward. This turned out to be one of the major obstacles I had, since I couldn't
				figure out a good way to attach them. I ended up using scene objects that I attached the actor to, but if
				the terraint was uneven they'd end up falling down or getting stuck which would dislocate them and cause
				all sorts of havoc. After some trial and error we decided to make sure that the terrain just didn't have
				any of the potholes and sharp angles that caused issues, that would probably be faster than actually fixing
				the problem since it looked good enough as it was already.
				<br>
				But, what if all the points were already occupied? Only that many agents have room to push the ram forward.
				The simple solution I made was to have a SceneObject trailing behind the ram that the agents would try to
				move towards. An improvement I'd potentially like to try in the future would be a more elegant way to
				simulate them following the ram as a crowd instead of moving to a point all at once. But since time was in
				short supply, like always, this was something that got pushed to the wishlist.
				<br>
				<br>The final part of the friendly AI puzzle was to tie them together to a system that would keep an eye
				on them and decide if a loss condition was triggered. The environment is separated into three regions and
				we decided that if the player ran out if friendly agents in their current region that would be the end.
				Since the player can't push the ram themselves that felt like a natural way to lose, but that was when
				the edge case cropped up: What if the ram is at a region door? You don't need agents to proceed at this
				stage, so we'd need the region change to happen in stages where you first unlock the new batch of agents
				and then actually transition forward (the gate was supposed to collapse behind you, but that got cut in
				the end).
				<br>This is managed in the GameMode, where all friendly agents will sign up once the game starts and
				register where they belong. In case they'd later die, they report back and remove themselves from the list
				and in case there's no more available friendly agents it would result in a game over. One caveat that cropped
				up here was that as agents that pushed the ram across region borders would also need to be updated to belong
				to the newly accessed region, as they'd otherwise not be accounted for correctly.
				<br>
				<br>I also had a small hand in making some of the Niagara effects like the teleportation and hit effects,
				which were kept as simple as possible while trying to make them stand out a bit.
				<br>A simple respawn system is also tied to the region transition, so if the player gets knocked out they
				wouldn't have to run back all the way from the start every time. This is part of why I had to make the region
				changes in parts, otherwise they would get access to the new friendly agents and respawn on the wrong side of
				the doors for instance.

				<p>For most of the project I worked with designing and implementing the two different AIs we used; one

				real-time.
