			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
			<p>Gaming has been with me since I was about three years old and my dad had me review some point-and-click
			games, and through the years that has evolved a lot. Exploring a lot of games through the years has helped
			me get a feeling of what might catch a person's interest and also to solve problems logically.
			<br>This naturally led me down the path of game development, starting with an engineering background and
			now also a more applied approach I have the tools to both defining the solution and applying it. To some
			extent I can also help figuring out the question, since that exercise in itself can be both entertaining
			and educational. Picking apart games and trying to figure out ways to improve them or seeing how they did
			something different is something I can spend a few hours on by accident, usually talking it over while
			playing it with friends.
			<br>
			<br>In my spare time, I try to sometimes step away from the computer and sit down with different kinds of
			games. Anything from card games, board games to tabletop RPGs, depending on who's available. A good book
			might make its way into the schedule from time to time as well.
			<br>
			<br>As for games I play, I'm very much an omnivore. The one genre I stay out of is horror but aside from that
			I believe that anything can be fun, though I tend to gravitate towards cooperative multiplayer games. Some
			highlights in no particular order: Factorio, EVE Online, WoW, Europa Universalis 4, Warframe, Vermintide 2,
			Star Wars: Empire at War, Across the Obelisk, Slay the Spire, Frostpunk.

			<h3>My responsibilities</h3>
			<p>First we got two weeks to come up with two prototypes and we decided to split the group and work on both in
			parallel, where I worked on one of the features in what would become Gravitum. My contribution was a mechanic
			that would let you walk on walls and the ceiling by manipulating the player's own gravity.
			<br>After that I made a small mission system to give hints to the player on what to do next, a respawn system
			and general requests from the designers.

			<h3>My responsibilities</h3>
			<p>The first task I had to tackle was the friendly AI, and since we didn't have a dedicated gameplay designer
			most of the details were left up to me but I still worked close with the project owner to realize the vision
			of what they were supposed to do.
			<br>This included setting up the general behaviour in BehaviourTree and the different ways to interact between
			the player and the agents. Later this evolved to include the agents' connection to the battering ram and the
			system controlling one of the loss-states: if all of the friendly agents died and/or were inaccessible.
			<br>Aside from the AI I also worked on the Niagara effects pertaining to hitting something with the hammer and
			teleporting the friendly agents.
			</p>
			<button type="button" class="collapsible project">Process</button>
			<div class="content">
				<p>The AI is made using a BehaviourTree and BlackBoard connected to blueprints that interface with the game
				world, this is layered on top of a C++ base class. This kind of structure felt to me like it would make it
				easier for programmer and designer alike to change and/or add behaviors where they made sense, or if we
				wanted to move something down to code and expose a blueprint node for example.
				<br>
				<br>The general design was that they were to activate and make noise when the player was nearby, and when
				interacted with they'd make their own way to the battering ram. This was quickly changed as we spoke about it,
				and to save some time on both design and programming for the MVP we decided to alter the behaviour. Now when
				they detect the player by hearing they will active and follow the player until interacted with and thereby
				teleported to the battering ram.
				<br>
				<br>As the agents are teleported to the battering ram they're supposed to attach to certain points and
				start pushing the ram forward. This turned out to be one of the major obstacles I had, since I couldn't
				figure out a good way to attach them. I ended up using scene objects that I attached the actor to, but if
				the terraint was uneven they'd end up falling down or getting stuck which would dislocate them and cause
				all sorts of havoc. After some trial and error we decided to make sure that the terrain just didn't have
				any of the potholes and sharp angles that caused issues, that would probably be faster than actually fixing
				the problem since it looked good enough as it was already.
				<br>
				But, what if all the points were already occupied? Only that many agents have room to push the ram forward.
				The simple solution I made was to have a SceneObject trailing behind the ram that the agents would try to
				move towards. An improvement I'd potentially like to try in the future would be a more elegant way to
				simulate them following the ram as a crowd instead of moving to a point all at once. But since time was in
				short supply, like always, this was something that got pushed to the wishlist.
				<br>
				<br>The final part of the friendly AI puzzle was to tie them together to a system that would keep an eye
				on them and decide if a loss condition was triggered. The environment is separated into three regions and
				we decided that if the player ran out if friendly agents in their current region it would be the end.
				Since the player can't push the ram themselves that felt like a natural way to lose, but that was when
				the edge case cropped up: What if the ram is at a region door? You don't need agents to proceed at this
				stage, so we'd need the region change to happen in stages where you first unlock the new batch of agents
				and then actually transition forward (the gate was supposed to collapse behind you, but that got cut in
				the end).
				<br>This is managed in the GameMode, where all friendly agents will sign up once the game starts and
				register where they belong. In case they'd later die, they report back and remove themselves from the list
				and in case there's no more available friendly agents it would result in a game over. One caveat that cropped
				up here was that as agents that pushed the ram across region borders would also need to be updated to belong
				to the newly accessed region, as they'd otherwise not be accounted for correctly.
				<br>
				<br>I also had a small hand in making some of the Niagara effects like the teleportation and hit effects,
				which were kept as simple as possible while trying to make them stand out a bit.
				<br>A simple respawn system is also tied to the region transition, so if the player gets knocked out they
				wouldn't have to run back all the way from the start every time. This is part of why I had to make the region
				changes in parts, otherwise they would get access to the new friendly agents and respawn on the wrong side of
				the doors for instance. This is just a simple list that the respawn points signs up to at the start of the game.

			<h3>My responsibilities</h3>
			<p>My main area during this project was to set up the different ways to unlock the doors and how to close them again.
			There's the kinds of switches for the player to interact with: levers, keys and "turbines". To activate the turbines
			the player has to wind them up by laying their oxygen line around them and then rewind, basically winding them up for
			a short while. All three of switches are connected to a timer that disconnects them after a delay, forcing the player
			to execute the puzzle with a time constraint.
			<br>Aside from that I also set up the basic controls, AudioManager and a communication system between the switches and
			the doors, the latter being completely rewritten in the latter half of the project due to an unforseen glitch.
			</p>
			<button type="button" class="collapsible project">Process</button>
			<div class="content">
				<p>The levers were very straight forward to implement, keys and sockets slightly more complicated. If the key is
				dropped, it will start crawling back to its starting position after a certain delay, the same if it's been
				slotted into a keyhole without solving the entire puzzle. Aside from returning to its position it's simply
				a matter of parenting the key to either the player's "hand" or the keyhole.
				<br>The turbines are a completely different beast as they can spin in a set direction (left or right around the
				Y-axis) for a set amount of time. I solved this by checking if the player is currently rewinding, which direction
				they're facing and since the rewind speed accellerates I also had to check that they're moving faster than a threshold.
				This is then compared to a plane centered on the turbine where it maps the player's position to a certain quadrant of
				the plane.
				<br>Say that the player is in the first quadrant (top left) and the turbine rotates clockwise, this would give
				that if the player faces in a downwards and/or leftward direction as they rewind fast enough they'll be going in the
				right direction.
				<br>
				<br>The doors themselves were keeping track on if they were supposed to open or not, using a matrix of how many
				locks they had and how many keys each lock had. They also used a simple coroutine timer, similar to the keys above,
				to determine if the door was successfully opened.
				<br>
				<br>Both of the above parts used a simple messageing system that utilized ScriptableObjects, since that was something
				we'd learned just a few weeks prior. The downside of this was that it for some reason didn't work when Unity baked the
				game into an executable, so that was a major setback hours before the prototype deadline and our doors didn't work in
				the deliverable. We had to rewrite the entire system the following week, but since I was in the middle of making the
				turbines work at the time that task fell to another programmer in the group.

			<h3>My responsibilities</h3>
			<p>The timeframe in this project really made us scramble to finish whatever needed doing at the time, so quite a few
			things ended up in my hands. The major features I worked with were the two enemy types, the raising lava and the
			quick-time events at the end. I also worked a fair while on jump-through platforms until someone from another group
			pointed out that such platforms already existed in Unity.
			</p>
			<button type="button" class="collapsible project">Process</button>
			<div class="content">
				<p>The two enemy types were one that falls from the top of the screen, basically an anvil or similar, and one that
				patrols a certain distance from a point and back. Both are fairly similar to the extent that they're more or less
				moving hitboxes powered by fixedUpdate. The spawner that creates the falling enemies is a coroutine timer that
				spawns them within a span centered on the player.
				<br>
				<br>The raising lava works in a similar fashion, fixedUpdate that raises it a certain amount per tick. In addition
				there's a couroutine that calculates the distance to the player and amplifies the raising if the distance is greater
				than a threshold.
				<br>
				<br>The QTEs at the very end of the game consists of challenges around clicking certain inputs in a certain order.
				To make it simple to add additional challenges I designed the system to use an abstract class containing the
				information needed to visualize the challenge and a callback to verify the input given.

			<h3>Short description</h3>
			<p>The big game project we did at LTU. It's a 1v1-4 game somewhat similar to Dungeonland for those familiar.
			Your goal is either to eliminate the heroes by summoning AI minnions or as the heroes to fight your way
			through the gauntlet to the final boss encounter.
			</p>
			<h3>My responsibilities</h3>
			<p>For most of the project I worked with designing and implementing the two different AIs we used; one
			ranged, stationary support type and one melee swarmer type. Aside from that I also implemented a file
			reader so we could reload scriptable values in real-time and also help the artists to place objects
			dynamically into the scene.
